## Current Status

- Phase 1 foundation is complete and verified.
- Phase 2 persistence/auth/tenant/audit spine is complete and verified.
- Phase 3 runtime control and LLM gateway foundation is complete and verified.
- Phase 4 policy corpus and snapshot foundation is complete at the current foundation layer.
- Phase 5 rule-pack foundation is complete and verified.
- Phase 6 case registry and dossier foundation is complete and verified.

## Next Critical Steps

1. Begin the document and artifact intake layer so cases can hold uploaded evidence, not just structured dossier fields.
2. Build extraction foundations that turn uploaded evidence into normalized facts and contradictions.
3. Start connecting the rule-pack foundation to case data through a deterministic assessment service.
4. Keep migrations, tests, and continuity docs aligned as the intake layer expands.
